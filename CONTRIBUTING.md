## Code guidelines
Client-Side Implementation with CLI (Cobra Packages)

When working on the client side, which is implemented using CLI through Cobra packages, refer to [this link](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) for guidance on adding new commands.
for adding new command :

1- cmd File Structure:

Inside the cmd directory, you'll find two main files: cost and ingestion. These files are directly related to the cost and ingestion commands in the CLI.

2- Cost and Ingestion Subsets:

Within the cmd directory, you can extend functionality by adding desired commands or flags to the cost and ingestion subsets. Follow the structure provided by Cobra packages for seamless integration.
